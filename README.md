# ssh-ldap-helper

a simple bash script cadged and updated from around the internet (other versions didn't work quite right).  

Suitable for use with OpenSSH public key authentication against LDAP; should work with any distro (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc...) though RH flavors already have a working binary for this in openssh-ldap package.
